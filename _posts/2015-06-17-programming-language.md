I love how simple and clear [this explanation][wic] of code and programming is and wish I could have read it when I first started.  
This particular part seems obvious in retrospect, but would have helped grasped coding earlier than I did:

> A programming language has at least two jobs, then. It needs to wrap up lots of algorithms so they can be reused. Then you don’t need to go looking for a square-root algorithm (or a genius programmer) every time you need a square root. And it has to make it easy for programmers to wrap up new algorithms and routines into functions for reuse.
