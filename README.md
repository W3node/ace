## Installation

- Install Jekyll: `gem install jekyll`
- [Fork this repository][fork]
- Clone it: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USER/ace`
- Run the Jekyll server: `jekyll serve -w`

You should have a server up and running locally at http://localhost:4000.

## Customization

Next you'll want to change a few things. Most of them can be changed directly in `_config.yml`.
That's where you will put the name, the URL and the description of your blog and other settings.
